"""
Comprehensive unit tests for the query_rewriter module.

This test suite is divided into two main sections:
1.  **TestQueryRewriting**: Focuses on the ability of the function to correctly
    rewrite queries based on conversational context.
2.  **TestQueryClassification**: Focuses on the function's ability to accurately
    classify queries as on-topic, off-topic, or harmful based on the robust
    prompting logic.
